# Roadmap
## Phase 1: Foundations
### ðŸ”¹ Goals:
Understand DevOps philosophy (CI/CD, collaboration, automation).

Learn Linux basics and shell scripting.

Get comfortable with Git and GitHub.

### ðŸ”§ Tools:
Git + GitHub

Bash / Shell

VS Code

### ðŸ“˜ Resources:
ðŸ“˜ Udemy â€“ The Complete Git Guide: (great intro to Git)

ðŸ“˜ LinuxCommand.org or Codecademy's Learn the Command Line

ðŸ“˜ Codecademy â€“ Learn Git

### ðŸ›  Assignments:
Create a GitHub repo and push changes from your terminal.

Write bash scripts to automate simple tasks (e.g., backup a folder).

Clone and contribute to a GitHub repo.

## Phase 2: Core DevOps Skills
### ðŸ”¹ Goals:
Learn CI/CD concepts and implement pipelines.

Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Learn containerization and basic cloud skills.

### ðŸ”§ Tools:
Docker

Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Terraform (for IaC)

AWS (or GCP / Azure basics)

### ðŸ“˜ Resources:
ðŸ“˜ Udemy â€“ Docker Mastery (by Bret Fisher)

ðŸ“˜ Udemy â€“ CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins

ðŸ“˜ Udemy â€“ Terraform on AWS

ðŸ“˜ AWS Skill Builder

ðŸ“˜ Katacoda â€“ practice environments (amazing for hands-on)

### ðŸ›  Assignments:
Containerize a basic Node.js or Python app using Docker.

Set up a Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipeline to build & deploy that app.

Use Terraform to spin up an EC2 instance on AWS.

## Phase 3: Monitoring, Scaling & Security
### ðŸ”¹ Goals:
Set up monitoring, alerting, and logging.

Understand scaling and orchestration with Kubernetes.

Learn basic security best practices.

### ðŸ”§ Tools:
Prometheus + Grafana

Kubernetes (Minikube or kind locally, then cloud-based)

AWS IAM

Vault (optional)

### ðŸ“˜ Resources:
ðŸ“˜ Udemy â€“ Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners

ðŸ“˜ Prometheus & Grafana Monitoring Course â€“ free on YouTube

ðŸ“˜ FreeCodeCamp â€“ Kubernetes Crash Course

### ðŸ›  Assignments:
Set up monitoring of your deployed app using Prometheus + Grafana.

Deploy your app to a Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts.

Secure access with IAM roles, access control lists, and secrets.

## Phase 4: Real-World DevOps Projects
### ðŸ”¹ Goals:
Apply everything in a real-world project.

Practice debugging, logging, deployment strategies.

Learn FinOps basics (cost efficiency) and incident response.

### ðŸ”§ Tools:
Full AWS stack

ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Cloud-native tools (Lambda, ECS, EKS)

### ðŸ›  Project Ideas:
ðŸš€ End-to-End Deployment Pipeline: Build a CI/CD pipeline from GitHub â†’ Docker â†’ Jenkins/GitHub Actions â†’ Kubernetes â†’ Monitored with Prometheus.

ðŸ§¾ Terraform + AWS: Set up a full production-grade infrastructure with load balancer, auto-scaling group, and EC2 instances.

ðŸ“Š Log Analysis Dashboard: Send app logs to ELK and build visualizations for error tracking and performance.

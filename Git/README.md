# ✅ Git Skills Specifically Valuable in DevOps
While the basics (commit, push, pull, branches, merge) are enough for development, DevOps workflows often involve Git in automation, collaboration, and CI/CD contexts. Here's what you should add to your toolkit:

## 🔧 1. GitOps Principles
- What it is: Managing infrastructure and deployments declaratively using Git as the single source of truth.

- Learn: Tools like ArgoCD or Flux use Git repositories to auto-deploy to Kubernetes.

- Next Step: Later, when you're deploying to Kubernetes, explore GitOps-based deployments.

## 🔁 2. Advanced Branching Strategies
Why: DevOps roles often involve enforcing or automating Git workflows across teams.

Learn:

- Git Flow vs Trunk-based development

- Release branches, hotfix branches, tagging

- Resource: Atlassian Git Workflow Guide

## 🏷 3. Semantic Versioning & Git Tagging
- Why: For releases, CI/CD systems often use tags to trigger deployments.

- Commands to Learn:

```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```


## 🔄 4. Rebase, Cherry-Pick, and Interactive Rebase
- Why: Useful in CI pipeline debugging or preparing clean release branches.

- Learn:
```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```

## ⚙️ 5. Git Hooks
- Why: Automate checks, enforce standards, or run tests before commit/push.

- Example: Run Prettier or ESLint on commit, or prevent commits to main.

- Resource: Udemy – Git Hooks: Getting Started

- Tool: Explore Husky for managing Git hooks in JavaScript projects.

## 🧪 6. Integrating Git in CI/CD Pipelines
- Learn:

    - Using Git SHA for build/version identifiers

    - Detecting changes in specific folders to trigger deployments

    - Auto-generating changelogs via commit messages

## 📘 Optional Deep-Dives
- Git internals: git fsck, git reflog, resolving detached HEAD issues

- Security: Signed commits (git commit -S) and verifying commit history

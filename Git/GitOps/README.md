# 🔁 What Is GitOps (Quick Recap)
**GitOps = Git + Infrastructure as Code + Continuous Deployment.**

With tools like ArgoCD or Flux, your Git repository becomes the single source of truth for infrastructure and app state. Any change merged into Git automatically syncs to a live Kubernetes cluster.

## 🔹 Phase 1: Learn GitOps Concepts (1–2 days)
Objective: Understand how GitOps differs from traditional CI/CD.

### 🧠 Topics:
- What is GitOps?

- Push-based vs Pull-based deployment models

- Git as the source of truth

- The role of ArgoCD and Flux

- Benefits: auditability, rollback, security

### 📚 Resources:
- Weaveworks GitOps Intro – from the folks who coined the term

- GitOps Fundamentals – Codefresh Free Course – Beginner-friendly with visual examples

- Blog: GitOps vs Traditional DevOps


## 🔹 Phase 2: Set Up a GitOps Lab (2–5 days)
Objective: Set up a local (or cloud-based) GitOps workflow using ArgoCD or Flux.

### ✅ Tools:
- Kubernetes (Kind, Minikube, or a free cloud cluster on Civo or DigitalOcean)

- ArgoCD (recommended first tool — great UI and active community)

- A GitHub repo with a sample app and Kubernetes manifests

### 🛠️ Setup Guides:
- ArgoCD Quickstart: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/

- Flux Getting Started: https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/

- Demo repo with manifests: GitOps Example with ArgoCD

## 🔹 Phase 3: Create Your Own GitOps Project (1 week)
Objective: Build a small real-world project.

### 💡 Project Idea:
    Deploy a React frontend (maybe your own side project) and a Node.js backend to a Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD, fully driven from a GitHub repo.

Components:

- Two services: frontend and backend

- Git repo holds all manifests (or use Kustomize/Helm for templating)

- Auto-sync via ArgoCD when changes are pushed

Optional Bonus:
- Add staging and production environments using ArgoCD’s ApplicationSets

- Integrate a simple CI step (e.g. GitHub Actions builds image + pushes to Docker Hub, then ArgoCD deploys)

## 📦 Advanced (Later)
- Helm + ArgoCD or Flux (templated deployments)

- Secrets management with Sealed Secrets or External Secrets Operator

- Multi-cluster GitOps

- Argo Rollouts (blue-green / canary deployments)
